=============
Notes after the fact:
- When working with currency systems, I've heard it's generally better to use the BigDecimal library because of its accuracy in representing large numbers. I used doubles though just because I didn't think it was in the scope of this project.
- The assignment stated that my code should be clear enough that comments shouldn't be necessary, so I omitted them.
  - As such I also didn't include javadocs due to my personal time constraints.
